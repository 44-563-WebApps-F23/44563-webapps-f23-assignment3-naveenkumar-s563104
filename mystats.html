        Hi. I am from India, I have 15 years of Teaching experience, but that's not in Computer Science. I write poems which is creative writing. I always prefer to have a regular routine. And, I love morning walks.

    <h3>South-Indian Thali</h3>
    <p>I like South-Indian Thali because it is one of the best dishes in the world, which 
        is a very balanced nutritious food, and is very tasty, finger-licking good!
